# arXiv LaTeX Translator & Compiler (Modern Solution)

This skill handles the end-to-end workflow of converting an arXiv paper's LaTeX source into a translated PDF on Windows, macOS, and Linux using modern `xeCJK` and `fontspec`.

## Workflow

### 0. Pre-flight Dependency Check
Before starting, verify that all required system tools are installed.
- **Windows (PowerShell):** `Get-Command curl, tar, xelatex, bibtex -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`
- **macOS / Linux (Bash):** `for cmd in curl tar xelatex bibtex; do command -v $cmd >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "Missing: $cmd"; done`

### 1. Identify & Download
- Extract the ID (e.g., `2508.11825v2`) from the URL or find it via search.
- Create a target directory and download/extract the source and the paper pdf (for final check) using native tools (`curl`, `tar`).
  - Abstract: `https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx`
  - Source: `https://arxiv.org/src/xxxx.xxxxx`
  - PDF: `https://arxiv.org/pdf/xxxx.xxxxx.pdf`

### 2. Analyze & Modularize (For Large Papers)
- Read the original `.pdf` file to build a mental map.
- **Modularization Strategy (Crucial for Reliability):**
    - **DO NOT use the `replace` tool for content translation.** It is prone to whitespace/encoding mismatches.
    - Instead, **YOU MUST** execute the standardized script located at `scripts/split_tex.py` (relative to this SKILL directory) to safely split the monolithic `.tex` file into sub-files by `\section`. Do not attempt to write a custom splitting script.
      - **Command to run:** Locate the skill directory and run `python3 <path_to_skill_dir>/scripts/split_tex.py <main_file.tex>`
    - For small files, you may still use `replace` or directly overwrite the file with `write_file`.
- **Terminology Glossary:** Create a local mental glossary of 5-10 core technical terms to ensure consistency.

### 3. Atomic Translation (Write-File Overwrite)
- **Work on Chunks:** Translate one sub-file (or one section) at a time.
- **Overwrite Mode:** Use the `write_file` tool to write the fully translated content into the sub-files. This avoids the "string not found" errors common with the `replace` tool.
- **Content Preservation:** Rigorously preserve LaTeX commands, math environments, citations, and references.
- **Modern Chinese Support (xeCJK)**:
    - Inject `\usepackage{xeCJK}` and `\setCJKmainfont{Microsoft YaHei}` (or platform equivalent) into the main preamble.

### 4. Compile & Auto-Fix
- Use `xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode`.
- **Standard compilation loop:** `xelatex` -> `bibtex` -> `xelatex` x2.
- **Error Auto-Fixing:** If compilation fails, read the `.log` file, identify the error line, and fix the corresponding sub-file using `write_file` or `replace`.

### 5. Integrity Verification & Review
- **Completeness Check:** Verify all sub-files in `sections/` are translated.
- **Visual Check:** Compare the translated PDF with the original.
- Clean up intermediate files and move the final `_CN.pdf` to the root.

## Guidelines
- **Prefer `write_file` over `replace` for Translation**: Overwriting a small, dedicated section file is 100% reliable compared to searching for a literal string in a 20,000-line file.
- **Font Selection**:
    - Windows: `Microsoft YaHei` or `SimSun`.
    - macOS: `PingFang SC`.
    - Linux: `Noto Sans CJK SC`.
- **Preserve Template**: Use `xeCJK` to minimize style interference.
- **Heredocs**: Use single-quoted heredocs in shells to handle backslashes correctly.
